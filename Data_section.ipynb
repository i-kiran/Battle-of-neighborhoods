    "I chose this data set as it is published by UK government and therefore it has better probability of correctness as compared to other datasets. It has all the attributes regarding locality , Postcode that simplifies the search . I will also be accessing Foursquare Api for detailed facilities available at the various streets to provide a clear comparison. It will help in getting data for the fast food chains around the future property and when combining it with the price paid data per house to get the best property for our needs.\n",
