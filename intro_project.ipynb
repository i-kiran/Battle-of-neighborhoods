As a result, the business problem is where can we buy a suitable house in Southampton, UK when we are having a housing boom which drives prices ever higher and when you don't have time to cook and you don't like cooking. As a data scientist/house broker we will do a cluster of Southampton neighborhoods to get the venues with the best prices and we will be looking for cheap nearby fast-food chains and elementary schools for your children.Here the use of Foursquare - an Api which provides most updated data regarding the places to visit , food junctions , daily needs availability will help providing a detailed view of the luxuries and facilities preent in Southampton.
